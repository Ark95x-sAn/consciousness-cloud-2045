## 📋 COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Individual Spin-Up (Day 1)
1. Create 9 separate Sintra AI conversations
2. Use conversation starters above
3. Share GitHub repo context: https://github.com/Ark95x-sAn/consciousness-cloud-2045
4. Let each agent begin their specialty work

### Phase 2: Daily Sync (Days 2-7)
**Morning Sync (9 AM):**
- Agent 9 (Coordinator) polls all agents
- Identifies completed work
- Surfaces blockers
- Sets daily priorities

**Evening Report (5 PM):**
- Each agent reports progress
- Coordinator compiles 5-min summary
- Commander approves next day priorities

### Phase 3: Cross-Pollination (Ongoing)
**When agents need to collaborate:**
- Use shared GitHub repo for handoffs
- Tag relevant agents in documentation
- Coordinator facilitates information flow
- Keep conversation threads active

---

## 🔗 CONVERSATION CONTINUITY SYSTEM

### Method 1: GitHub as Central Hub
```
/agents/
  ├── architect/
  │   ├── daily-log.md
  │   └── handoffs.md
  ├── revenue/
  │   ├── offers.md
  │   └── pipeline.md
  └── [etc]
```

Each agent commits their work daily. Others pull and build on it.

### Method 2: Conversation Links
Maintain a "Master Handoff Doc" where agents reference:
- Their Sintra conversation URL
- Latest outputs
- Next actions
- Dependencies on other agents

### Method 3: Coordinator as Hub
Agent 9 maintains context across all conversations:
- Summarizes each agent's progress
- Identifies where outputs connect
- Facilitates handoffs
- Prevents duplicate work
